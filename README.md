## Browser Support
Support does not mean that everybody gets the same thing. Expecting two users using different browser software to have an identical experience fails to embrace or acknowledge the heterogeneous essence of the Web.

* **C-grade** - C-grade is the base level of support, providing core content and functionality. It is sometimes called core support. Delivered via nothing more than semantic HTML, the content and experience is highly accessible, unenhanced by decoration or advanced functionality, and forward and backward compatible. Layers of style and behavior are omitted. — [Ref. 1](#References)

   *Summary: C-grade browsers are incapable, antiquated and rare. Examples of C-grade browsers include IE 10 and earlier, Netscape, Opera, and other End of Life browsers.*

* **A-grade** - A-grade support is the highest support level. By taking full advantage of the powerful capabilities of modern web standards, the A-grade experience provides advanced functionality and visual fidelity. — [Ref. 1](#References)

   *Summary: A-grade browsers are capable, modern and common. Examples of A-grade browsers include latest stable version of Edge, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, etc.*

* **X-grade** - X-grade provides support for unknown, fringe or rare browsers as well as browsers on which development has ceased. Browsers receiving X-grade support are assumed to be capable. (If a browser is shown to be incapable — if it chokes on modern methodologies and its user would be better served without decoration or functionality — then it should considered a C-grade browser.) — [Ref. 1](#References)

   *Summary: X-grade browsers are assumed to be capable and modern. Examples of X-grade browsers include Nightly/Canary/Preview/Developer Builds*
